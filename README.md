# Key Considerations for an Experimentation Platform

1. **User Interface**: 
   - The experimentation platform should have a user-friendly interface, making it easy to navigate while offering comprehensive functionality.

2. **Roles and Permissions**: 
   - The experimentation platform should implement a robust roles and permissions system, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data or features.

3. **Data Visualization**: 
   - The experimentation platform should be able to clearly visualize experimental data for easy analysis, possibly through graphs, charts, or other visual representations.

4. **Experiment Creation and Management**: 
   - The experimentation platform should allow users to easily create, run, stop, and manage experiments.

5. **Auditing and Logging**: 
   - The experimentation platform should log every action taken within the system for audit purposes, helping trace any issues or anomalies that occur during an experiment.

6. **Integration**: 
   - Depending on the specific needs, the experimentation platform might need to integrate with other tools or systems, such as data collection tools, analytics platforms, or other software relevant to the experiments.

7. **Scalability**: 
   - The experimentation platform should be designed to scale with user needs, being capable of handling an increasing amount of work or being enlarged to accommodate growth.

8. **Security**: 
   - The experimentation platform should be secure, with measures in place to protect against data breaches or unauthorized access.

9. **Documentation**: 
   - The experimentation platform should come with clear and comprehensive documentation for its users.

10. **Support**: 
   - The experimentation platform should provide mechanisms for users to receive help when they encounter problems or have questions.

> Remember, the design and feature set of the experimentation platform will heavily depend on the specific needs and use cases.
